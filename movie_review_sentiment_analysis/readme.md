# Todo Lists

1. data pre-processing
* find the maximun length sentences from training set
* apply padding to all train + test dataset, so all the sentences will have the same length (because input layer can only accept same fixed input size)


2. find pretrain word-embedding online source
* good word-embedding can present the meaning of words
* word-embedding will convert charater words into integers with meanings

3. design neural network architect
* better test with LSTM, RNN, GRU
* implement with Keras or tensorflow
